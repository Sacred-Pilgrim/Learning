# Learning
My first repository for GitHub
This serves as a tutorial for using GitHub for the very first time.

# Update after 2years
After using the following [School Github Profile](https://github.com/u16220073), a extra  [course from udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-crash-course/?couponCode=NEW_COURSE2) was taken to further improve understanding of git & github.

The following are the few notes made from the course...
1) You can Use "git diff" to check the difference between the current version of a tracked file vs the last time you commited it.

2) You can use "git ls-files" to list all the files that are part of the GIT repo.
   If you want to list all files for a specific branch, e.g. master use [git ls-tree -r master --name-only](https://superuser.com/questions/429693/git-list-all-files-currently-under-source-control)
